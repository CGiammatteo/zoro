# Zoro - A Pristine Roblox Trade Bot

Created over a multi-month timespan with the task of trading Roblox limited items to make as much profit as possible

Since tradebots were messed up by Roblox when they added a 100 day-trade limit, I decided to release the source code to the bot. 

I had integrated the following into the bot:
- custom item scoring
- proxy rotation
- outbound trading
- an actual good trade creation algorithm (other bots had absolutely horrible algs compared to the one I utilize)
- item blacklisting
- sophisticated configuration files, so people can change whatever settings they wanted
- discord webhook integration
- multiple ways of finding viable traders

What the bot still needs:
- inbound checking
- outbound checking

Some pictures of the bot and others below:
